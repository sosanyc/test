            <h2>About Minecraft</h2>
            <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-mojang-studios" target="_blank">Mojang Studios</a>.  Since its release in 2009, Minecraft 
            has evolved significantly, becoming one of the best-selling video games of all time.

            At its core, Minecraft is about exploration, creativity, and survival. 
            Players begin in a blocky, pixelated landscape where they can gather resources, craft tools and items, build structures, and interact with a dynamic environment. 
            The game offers two primary modes:
            <bold>Survival Mode:</bold> Players must gather resources, manage their health and hunger, and defend against hostile mobs (creatures) that spawn in the dark. 
            Survival mode challenges players to explore underground caves, mine valuable ores, and build shelters to survive the night.
            <bold>Creative Mode:</bold> In this mode, players have unlimited resources and can fly freely around the world. 
            Creative mode is ideal for building grand structures, experimenting with different block types, and unleashing boundless imagination without the constraints of survival gameplay.
